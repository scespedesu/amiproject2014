abstract = {The purpose of this survey is to present a critical overview of smart grid concepts, with a special focus on the role that communication, networking and middleware technologies will have in the transformation of existing electric power systems into smart grids. First of all we elaborate on the key technological, economical and societal drivers for the development of smart grids. By adopting a data-centric perspective we present a conceptual model of communication systems for smart grids, and we identify functional components, technologies, network topologies and communication services that are needed to support smart grid communications. Then, we introduce the fundamental research challenges in this field including communication reliability and timeliness, QoS support, data management services, and autonomic behaviors. Finally, we discuss the main solutions proposed in the literature for each of them, and we identify possible future research directions.},

abstract = {A number of governments and organizations around the world agree that the first step to address national and international problems such as energy independence, global warming or emergency resilience, is the redesign of electricity networks, known as Smart Grids. Typically, power grids have "broadcasted" power from generation plants to large population of consumers on a suboptimal way. Nevertheless, the fusion of energy delivery networks and digital information networks, along with the introduction of intelligent monitoring systems (Smart Meters) and renewable energies, would enable two- way electricity trading relationships between electricity suppliers and electricity consumers. The availability of real-time information on electricity demand and pricing, would enable suppliers optimizing their delivery systems, while consumers would have the means to minimize their bill by turning on appliances at off-peak hours. The construction of the Smart Grid entails the design and deployment of information networks and systems of unprecedented requirements on storage, real-time event processing and availability. In this paper, a series of system architectures to store and process Smart Meter reading data are explored and compared aiming to establish a solid foundation in which future intelligent systems could be supported.},

abstract = {This paper presents a network-assisted mobility support scheme for 6L0WPAN nodes, which enables multi-hop communication between the Gateway (GW) and the mobile 6L0WPAN devices (MNs), with minimum mobility related signaling at the MN's end as compared to conventional mobility related protocols like MIPv6. The scheme provides mobility support to the MNs with the help of low cost static 6L0WPAN devices (SNs) which can be deployed in large numbers. In order to reduce the handover latency, the MN in the proposed scheme is assigned a fixed address which remains unchanged during its course of movement within the network. Moreover the scheme aims to reduce packets loss of the MN by predicting its future location and having a provision of buffering its packet at SNs when needed. The signaling overhead consumption needed to support a MN is determined through analytical modeling.},

abstract = {Today, the whole energy sector is going to enter a phase of far-reaching revolution. The legacy power generation and transmission concept is converting to a massively distributed energy generation landscape integrating an extensive number of variable and small renewable energy resources such as biomass or PV installations with all their challenging effects on the energy grid. New stakeholders (e.g. energy resource aggregators), more flexibility for the consumers (energy market place), and totally new concepts (loading of e-Cars, usage of e-Cars as flexible power storage) have to be respected. Innovative monitoring and control concepts are required to operate these distributed energy resources in a reliable and safe way. This paper describes the principles for an efficient management of a massively distributed energy system based on small and variable energy resources. For evaluation purposes of this approach a newly developed coupled energy grid communication network simulator is introduced with which large scale aspects of the new ICT management frame¬works can be studied in a smart grid environment.},

New ideas, such as the Smart Grid concept, are trying to give solutions to the energy problems by means of a modern power grid with intelligent management capabilities. In such scenarios, networking solutions, e.g., the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), will allow appliances to be remotely coordinated in order to optimize the total power consumption, and balance the power demand. This paper presents an innovative implementation of the IPv6 stack over the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer. Our 6LoWPAN implementation aims to provide a support platform for IPv6 over interoperable constrained-resources devices, such as those embedded in the electrical appliances. Our main goals are to optimize the memory management and to address the portability problems of the stack. In particular we want to develop a stack which is not tied to a particular data-link protocol. Comparison with existing solutions is also provided.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a communication stack for powerline communication (PLC) based on open standards. Our aim is to provide interoperability features regarding others mediums with a robust and reliable communication stack for smart metering, home control or home area networks applications. Our work is based on the adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol. It is constrained by the low-power, lossy and low data-rate context of powerline transceiver that uses pulse modulation. We first make a quick survey and justify the use of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard over PLC by drawing a parallel with the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). We then focus on the convergence of the IPv6 protocol at the network level, with the 6LoWPAN adaptation. We present our initial implementation of the RPL setup and routing protocol. This allows for a full network layer stack and results in efficient routing in our low power, low data-rate and lossy network context. We then present a real testbed of this stack and the step by step validation of its performance with experiments of data exchanges between PLC nodes. Finally we present interoperability tests performed between wireless and PLC nodes. We conclude about the interest of such interoperability for the real usage of sensor networks with a feedback from field’s applications deployment and our future work.},

abstract = {Existing routing protocols for sensor networks ei- ther exclusively focus on collection-based traffic, or optimize for point-to-point traffic in a homogeneous network. As these networks become more general, a mix of these workloads in a heterogeneous setting is expected, while still abiding by the resource constraints of low- power and lossy networks (L2Ns). Our design leverages the predominantly two-tiered topology of L2N deployments, with capable border routers supplementing resource-starved in- network nodes, and optimizes for the typical traffic workloads consisting mainly of collection based traffic with specific instances of point-to-point traffic. We present Hydro, a hybrid routing protocol that combines local agility with centralized control. In-network nodes use distributed DAG formation to provide default routes to border routers, concurrently forming the foundation for triangle point- to-point routing. Border Routers build a global, but typically incomplete, view of the network using topology reports received from in- network nodes, and subsequently install optimized routes in the network for active point-to-point flows. Building on the vast existing literature on distributed DAG for- mation in L2Ns and centralized routing in large-scale networks, our contribution lies in the merging of these ideas in the form of a routing protocol that addresses the needs of L2Ns while remaining grounded in their inherent constraints. Evaluations across testbeds and deployments demonstrate the performance and functionality of Hydro across a variety of workloads and network conditions.},

Experiences have shown that the hierarchical, centrally controlled grid of the 20th Century is ill-suited to the needs of the 21st Century. To address the challenges of the existing power grid, the new concept of smart grid has emerged. The smart grid can be considered as a modern electric power grid infrastructure for enhanced efficiency and reliability through automated control, high-power converters, modern communications infrastructure, sensing and metering technologies, and modern energy management techniques based on the optimization of demand, energy and network availability, and so on. While current power systems are based on a solid information and communication infrastructure, the new smart grid needs a different and much more complex one, as its dimension is much larger. This paper addresses critical issues on smart grid technologies primarily in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) issues and opportunities. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in smart grid communications as well as to discuss the still-open research issues in this field. It is expected that this paper will provide a better understanding of the technologies, potential advantages and research challenges of the smart grid and provoke interest among the research community to further explore this promising research area.},

In all of these applications mobility in sensor network with special attention to energy efficiency is a major issue to be addressed. Host based mobility management protocol is inherently unsuitable for energy inefficient IPWSN. So network-based mobility management protocol can be an alternative to the mobility supported IP-WSN.

We present its architecture, message formats and also analyze its performance considering signaling cost and mobility cost. Our analyses show that the proposed scheme reduces the signaling cost by 67\% and 60\% as well as reduces mobility cost by 55\% and 60\% with comparison to MIPv6 and PMIPv6 respectively.},

In this paper we propose DADR (Distributed Autonomous Depth-first Routing), a new distributed distance-vector routing protocol designed to adapt quickly to changing link conditions while minimizing network control overhead. In our algorithm, when a link fails, data packets are rerouted through an alternate next hop, and the information about the failed link is propagated with the data packet; therefore, routes are updated dynamically and with little overhead. We have implemented DADR on several link-layer technologies and deployed it in different applications, including AMI (advanced metering infrastructure) deployments in Japan; all implementations resulted in reliable networks that were easy to set up, maintain, and resilient to changing conditions.},

abstract = {Utility companies (electricity, gas, and water suppliers), governments, and researchers have been urging to deploy communication-based systems to read meters, known as automatic meter reading (AMR). An AMR system is envisaged to bring on benefits to customers, utilities, and governments. The advantages include reducing peak demand for energy, supporting the time-of-use concept for billing, enabling customers to make informed decisions, and reducing the cost of meter reading, to name a few. A key element in an AMR system is communications between meters and utility servers. Though several communication technologies have been proposed and implemented at a small scale, with the wide proliferation of wireless communication, it is the right time to critique the old proposals and explore new possibilities for the next generation AMR. We provide a comprehensive review of the AMR technologies proposed so far. Next, we present how future AMRs will benefit from third generation (3G) communication systems, the DLMS/COSEM (Data Language Messaging Specification/Companion Specification for Energy Metering) standard and Internet Protocol-based SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) signaling at the application level. The DLMS/COSEM standard provides a framework for meters to report application data (i.e. meter readings) to a utility server in a reliable manner. The SIP protocol is envisaged to be used as the signaling protocol between application entities running on meters and servers. The DLMS/COSEM standard and the SIP protocol are expected to provide an application level communication abstraction to achieve reliability and scalability. Finally, we identify the challenges at the application level that need to be tackled. The challenges include handling failure, gathering meter data under different time constraints (ranging from real-time to delay-tolerance), disseminating (i.e., unicasting, multicasting, broadcasting, and geocasting) control data to the meters, and achieving secure c ommunication.},

abstract = {Machine-to-machine communications is characterized by involving a large number of intelligent machines sharing information and making collaborative decisions without direct human intervention. Due to its potential to support a large number of ubiquitous characteristics and achieving better cost efficiency, M2M communications has quickly become a market-changing force for a wide variety of real-time monitoring applications, such as remote e-healthcare, smart homes, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. However, the flourishing of M2M communications still hinges on fully understanding and managing the existing challenges: energy efficiency (green), reliability, and security (GRS). Without guaranteed GRS, M2M communications cannot be widely accepted as a promising communication paradigm. In this article, we explore the emerging M2M communications in terms of the potential GRS issues, and aim to promote an energy-efficient, reliable, and secure M2M communications environment. Specifically, we first formalize M2M communications architecture to incorporate three domains - the M2M, network, and application domains - and accordingly define GRS requirements in a systematic manner. We then introduce a number of GRS enabling techniques by exploring activity scheduling, redundancy utilization, and cooperative security mechanisms. These techniques hold promise in propelling the development and deployment of M2M communications applications.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are expected to be deployed widely in various areas in coming years. The sensor device is small and has low computation power and memory thus perceived as not suitable to be loaded with the high resource IP capabilities. Due to this, the wireless sensor network remains isolated from the Internet. The emergence of IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has proved that IP communication is borderless and can be used for any devices. It provides a simple alternative to other wireless sensor networks and interoperable with IP-legacy systems and tools. However, the use of short addresses within the 6LoWPAN network is not visible to the outside world and hence a proper gateway is required. In this paper, we provide the architecture of the 6LoWPAN gateway which connects the wireless sensor world to the Internet. Our contribution is to provide direct accessibility to wireless sensor network using short address to full IPv6 address translation at the gateway. Our main focus is the flow of packets to and from the gateway including a simple address translation mechanism. The implementation and the use cases of the gateway are also highlighted.},

In this structure, a communications network is combined with the power grid in order to gather information that can be used to increase the efficiency of the grid, reduce power consumption, and improve the reliability of services, among other numerous advantages. SG communication networks are unique in their large scale and the limited capabilities of nodes which present several challenges in the design of efficient routing protocols. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the main networking challenges present in the design of SG communication networks, and some of the important routing protocols proposed to address those challenges. Various technologies and architectures proposed for routing in SGs are discussed.

abstract = {With the recent initiatives to upgrade the existing power grid to the Smart Grid (SG), there has been a significant interest in the design and development of an efficient communications infrastructure for connecting different components of the SG. In addition to the currently used underlying networks and protocols, new wired/wireless approaches are being planned for deployment for different components/applications of the SG. Based on the data requirements of the applications, new challenges have arisen at the network layer of the protocol stack with respect to routing and data forwarding. In this paper, we focus on the routing issues in the SG communications infrastructure which consists of different network components, such as Home Area Networks (HANs), Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). We provide a comprehensive survey of the existing routing research and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed protocols with respect different applications areas. We also identify the future research issues that are yet to be addressed with respect to the applications and network components. This survey is the first to identify routing design issues for the SG and categorize the proposed routing protocols from the SG applications perspective. We believe that this work will be valuable for the utilities and other energy companies whose target is to develop and deploy a specific SG application that may span different network components. In addition, this work will provide valuable insights for the newcomers who would like to pursue routing related research in the SG domain.},

abstract = {Recently the Ethernet managed to virtually displace competing process bus and local area network (LAN) technologies-Token Ring, Profibus, Modbusreg Plus, Lon Worksreg, etc.-most of which had to switch to the Ethernet-based physical layer and TCP/IP-based protocols (Modbus TCP/IP, Profibus TCP/IP, and DNP TCP/IP). Ethernet is still widely believed to be inadequate for mission-critical, hard real-time applications because of inherent limitations associated with the traditional collision-based access techniques. However, fostered by the development of international standards (IEEE 802.3x, 802.1q, 802.1p, 802.1w, IEC 61850-x-x), Ethernet has now evolved into a highly predictable and reliable realtime network technology. This paper provides an overview of the latest standards and investigates their impact on power system automation and protection. We give special attention to the use of the IEC GOOSE and IEC GSSE messages and to new options for streaming analog data over Ethernet described in IEC 61850-9-2. The paper includes application examples describing use of real-time Ethernet in distribution substation and industrial plant automation, such as fast bus trip, permissive transfer trip, and network reconfiguration-based breaker failure protection},

However, realization of the sensor networks for this AMI associated mudslide warning system needs to satisfy many constraints. In addition to the design factors identified by previous studies, such as fault tolerance, scalability, cost, hardware, topology change, environment, and power consumption, AMI brings limitations that come along with the electricity grid infrastructure.

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the scalability of three communication architectures for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grid. AMI in smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS) example, in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an AMI communication infrastructure. Scalability is one of the most important issues for the AMI deployment in smart grid. In this study, we introduce a new performance metric, accumulated bandwidthdistance product (ABDP), to represent the total communication resource usages. For each distributed communication architecture, we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the ABDP and the deployment cost of the meter data management system (MDMS). The simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one. More importantly, we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system (including MDMS) with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures. Through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis, we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as O($\lambda$N), with N being the number of smart meters, and $\lambda$ being the average traffic rate on a smart meter. In contrast, the total cost for the fully distributed communication architecture is O($\lambda$2/3 N2/3), which is significantly lower.},
